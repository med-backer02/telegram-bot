## Telegram Bot.
In our college we conduct testing with the help of Mytest program.
With its help we create tests.Unfortunately Mytest application supports
only windows operating system.I decided to fix it.
Tests written by Mytest program can be exported to pdf.
My Telegram bot just parses data from pdf and displays it to users.
Then it processes answers and displays test results.
